          <h2>Security architect &amp; technology strategist</h2>
          <p>
            As a security architect and technology strategist with more than a decade of experience helping enterprises
            modernize their security programs, I began my career engineering large-scale network infrastructures before
            moving into senior architecture and leadership roles where I guided Fortune 1000 organizations through the
            adoption of Zero Trust, SASE, cloud security, and MDR/NDR capabilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            On this blog I share thoughts, lessons learned, emerging patterns and practical observations drawn from
            real-world experience. My aim is to explore how organisations can adapt to a security-first mindset, how
            cloud/IAM/AI change the game, and what it takes to keep pace in a rapidly shifting environment.
